- 😄 Pronouns: yes, please. Anything but "it", leaning away from "he/him"
- 🌱 I’m currently learning golang
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that enhance the liberation of people and workers.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a fully professed and avowed nun.

My background is largely in developing tools and workflows for diverse teams
(fuck that sounds like a resume but whatever). I've worked for artists, audio
designers, structural engineers, graphic designers, software developers,
and for backend engineering teams developing tools to reduce toil and frustration.
